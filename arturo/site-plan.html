        How do I start?

        We can start talking about our tools, those tools include a 
computer, that could be a desktop or laptop, and the computer does not 
need to be extremely expensive, but at least you need something good 
that you can work without problems. We can talk about the specific 
propreties the computer needs later for some tips about technology.

The second tool is a program that needs to be downloaded in the 
computer, there are too many, but for the moment you can get thisones 
that are free:
Visual Studio Code
HubSpot
Blogger

There are others that you can download and start your free version but 
after that it will require a subscription such as:
Wordpress
Wix
Canva
WooComerce
Google sites

And there are too many but those are the ones that you can use.

Other tool that is required is getting a place that you can save your 
websites and public them, you can create the accoun in oe of these sites
 that are for free:
GitHub.
Firebase of Google
Netlify
Heroku
Vercel

Once everything is set up in the computer, let's start with the first 2 
topics that we need to be familiarized with wich are HTML and CSS.

      <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
      <p>
        Starting with HTML and CSS, these topics are the core of web 
design, learning how to use and create HTML files and folders is how we 
can start creating the body of our website.
        HTML is creating the skeleton, and creating a web site is like 
learning a new language, there are some terms and words that we need to 
be familiarized with and implement during the creation of our website.
        How to create an HTML file?
        I will put images during the process to demonstrate the creation
 of the html Body, showing the new words and their meaning.
        Then I will inlcude all the information that a beginner need in 
order to create and start practicing.
        Is going to be the same thing with CSS and how that is create, 
beginners can be familiarized with them and start from scratch without 
getting confused.

      <h3>Getting Ideas</h3>
      <p>
        On this part I will include all the creative stuff, such as 
typography, fonts, color palette and more tools that begginers need to 
start their own projects.
        I will include the websited that beginners can use to use these 
tools and how they can add them into their own website, some tips about 
contrasts, colors and how everything need to match to eachother and 
other websites that they can use to make sure their codes are good to 
go.
        Also I will incldue the support websites to help during the 
process and putting their ideas into their own projects.
